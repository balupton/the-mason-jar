Bloody Mary Danger
===========

Building a better bloody mary.

This project is just beginning, but I've got some big plans. My initial goal is to nail down the best bloody mary I possibly can. This will involve not only sourcing and experiementing with the best ingredients and recipies, but actually making my own infusions, mixes and maybe even garnishes.  I'll be sharing everything here and eventually hope to publish or share my findings (and, hopefully, some amazing tasting recipies) in a more formal way.

If you know me and want to help out, get in touch. At somepoint I'll be using this repo to capture feedback from tasting sessions and eventually whip up a process by where others can contribute.

Sl√°inte!
