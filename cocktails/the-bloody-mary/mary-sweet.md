The Mary Sweet
===========

A unique take on the bloody mary, for those who like things a bit sweeter.

Mix Ingredients
-----------

* 12 cups watermelon. Chunked.
* 1 teaspoon sugar, or to taste
* 1 1/2 cups tomato juice
* 1 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* Few dashes of hot sauce to taste.
* Pinch celery salt
* Freshly ground pepper


Mix Preparation
-----------
* Puree watermelon and sugar in blender. Strain into a bowl through a fine sieve, pressing with a rubber spatula; discard solids.
* Stir in tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.
* Season with pepper and celery salt.
* Stir or shake well and prepare to serve.

The Original Mary Danger
-----------

* Edge a large class with [sugar]().
* Pour in a shot or two of [Tabitha vodka](). Strain if needed.
* Pour in the mix, fill about 2/3rds of the glass.
* Add ice. Be sure and leave some room in the glass.
* Garnish with a watermellon slice and/or celery.


Notes
-----------

* Go easy on both celery and pepper as they can overwhelm the taste a bit.
* For a vegan version, use soy sauce or mix a bit of Bragg's Amino Acid with tamarind paste instead of Worchestershire.
