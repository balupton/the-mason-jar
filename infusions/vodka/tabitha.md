Tabitha
===========

A slightly sweet watermelon & rosemary infusion for use in watermelon-based marys.


Ingredients
-----------
* 3 cups cubed watermelon
* 2 springs fresh rosemary
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka.


Preparation
-----------

* Place cubed watermelon into a large, airtight jar.
* Fill the jar with vodka to cover the cubes.
* Seal jar and let steep for 6 days.
* Add rosemary sprigs on day 4.
* Strain the vodka into a clean jar or bottle.
* Discard watermelon and rosemary sprigs.


Notes
-----------

* Make sure to taste often. If left too long the rosemary sprigs can over power the watermellon flavor.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee fitler works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
