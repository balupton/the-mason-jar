Ingredients

Technique

To make the spiced honey syrup, combine the water, honey and sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the cloves, star anise, cinnamon stick, allspice and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Let cool and then strain the syrup into a container. Make sure the syrup is at room temperature before using, after using make sure to refrigerate.

In an ice-filled mixing glass, combine the whiskey, honey syrup, cherry liqueur and bitters. Stir with a bar spoon until cold. Pour into a double old fashioned (with as much ice as you like). Garnish with an orange peel.
