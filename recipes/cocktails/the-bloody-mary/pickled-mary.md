title: The Pickled Mary
---

[In Progress]. A spicy pickled take. Base loosely off of McClure's Spicy Bloody Mary Mix, which is awesome.

Mix Ingredients
-----------


* Freshly seeded, stemmed and chopped peppers. 1 red bell, 1 green bell pepper and one anaheim chili.
* 1/4 cup or so chopped garlic.
* 2 small tomatoes. Chopped into chunks.
* 4 oz tomato paste
* 1 cup tomato juice.
* 1 1/2 cup spicy pickle juice [You can use McClures spicy brine](http://www.mcclurespickles.com/products/brine) or any other pickle juice you have on hand.
* 1/2 cup cucumber juice
* 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* Fresh dill
* Freshly ground black pepper


Mix Preparation
-----------
* Chop the peppers, tomato and garlic into small chunks. Place them in large Dutch oven.  Add a splash of water, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are mushy, 30 â€“ 40 minutes.  Stir occasionally, breaking up the vegetables with the back of a spoon.  When everything is mushy, leave to cool for a few minutes.
* Puree the veggies.
* (Optional if you want a thinner consistency.) Strain into a bowl or jar through sieve, pressing with a rubber spatula; discard solids.
* Add everything else. Puree a bit more.
* Season with pepper and celery salt.
* Stir or shake well and prepare to serve.

The Pickled Mary
-----------

* Edge a large class with [salt]().
* Pour in a shot or two of [Ursula cucumber vodka](). Strain if needed.
* Pour in the mix, fill about 2/3rds of the glass.
* Add ice. Be sure and leave some room in the glass.
* Garnish with a variety of pickled goods.


Notes
-----------

* If you don't strain the veggies it'll come out a bit thick. Almost smoothly like, but not chunky. Some love it this way, others don't.
* You can play a bit of mix n' match with the peppers for variety.
* Add more pickle juice for a more pickley flavor. Add more tomato juice for a more traditional tomato flavor.
* Go easy on both celery and pepper as they can overwhelm the taste a bit.
